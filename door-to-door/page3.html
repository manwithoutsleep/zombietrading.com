      <h1>Luke 10:2</h1>
      Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the
      labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that
      he would send forth labourers into his harvest.

      We at World Wide Door to Door Ministries (W.W.D.T.D.M.) have our
      sights set on quantity of contacts. We believe we plant a seed
      &amp; the Holy Spirit produces the harvest. Our objective is to
      save souls, it is not to see if we can necessarily get the
      prospective soul to your Church, but to become part of the Body
      of Jesus Christ. Most Church evangelical outreaches deal with on
      the spot conversion&hellip; or at least that is the objective. That
      is not the case with World Wide Door to Door Ministries; we deal
      with the philosophy of Johnny Appleseed: Plant the seed &amp;
      move on! My point is to have a 5-7-minute format. If it goes
      over, so what? We count on prayer support &amp; the powers of
      the Holy Spirit to guide us to the proper people &amp; at least
      a 5-minute occasion to get a blessing from the witness to the
      prospective soul. It's the story of the Mustard Seed Matthew
      13:31-32; it's all about FAITH in Jesus that grows to be a large
      tree. However, it starts out as the tiniest seed known &amp;
      grows &amp; grows! You never know where that next Billy Graham is
      going to come from, but you do know this much: That seed came
      from somewhere.
