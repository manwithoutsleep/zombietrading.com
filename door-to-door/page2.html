      My name is Jeff Wesley. I was born in Chicago, IL and moved to Columbia,
      MO in 1990. In 1993 I was Born-Again Evangelical. I studied a great deal
      &amp; became a strong Christian advocate for the Lord 15 years later. The
      reason it was such a lengthy process, Christianity is a Journey, rather
      than an excellent overnight adventure. Building a relationship with Jesus
      takes time, it's not only an Eternal Perspective, but also a Spirituality
      that everybody needs. May World Wide Door to Door Ministries be just what
      you're looking for; as a spare time SERVICE TO THE LORD or TO RECRUIT FOR
      PEOPLE, FOR YOUR CHURCH. Regardless if you go out solo or in groups of
      2-3, all a person needs is a Testimony with contact information supplied
      on the Testimony. Also, information about church service times and Bible
      studies or anything else for follow Up (brochures or pastors business
      cards work just fine).<br />
