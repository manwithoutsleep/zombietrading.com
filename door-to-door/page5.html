        <p>
            When going Door to Door and <span class="bold underline italic">Handing out
            TESTIMONIES, you just might be contacted... then what?</span> I call these
            the A, B, C's of DOOR TO DOOR contacts. These contacts will usually fall
            into 3 different/separate catagories or the A, B, C's of DOOR TO DOOR contacts.
        </p>
 
        <p><span class="bold underline italic">The A, B, C's of World Wide DOOR TO DOOR Ministries contacts:</span></p>
         
        <p><span class="bold">Type A</span>---<span class="underline italic">The Willing</span></p>

        <p>
            They are the HOT AND READY FOR SERVICE! These are the contacts who go and get
            straight into the flock of sheep, under the direction of the Pastor or
            Hierarchy of the Church. These are good sheep in the Shepard's flock and
            listen to the Pastor and Hierarchy closely. Thus; can grow to be terrific
            assets to the Church!
        </p>

        <p><span class="bold">Type B</span>---<span class="underline italic">The Lost</span></p>

        <p>
            These are the people who contact you from your Testimony who need time and
            love, an open ear and advice. Who are ready for the good life of Christianity,
            but don't know how to get there! They also may need
            <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=exodus+20&version=KJV" target="_blank">Exodus 20:1-17</a> and
            <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+10&version=KJV" target="_blank">Luke 10:27</a> through
            <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=galatians+3&version=KJV" target="_blank">Galatians 3:24</a>.
        </p>
         
        <p><span class="bold">Type C</span>---<span class="underline italic">The Rebellious</span></p>

        <p>
            Be careful not to spend too much time with these types. Chances are they will
            never change. They can be time stealers who take your valuable time, that you
            could be using for more World Wide Door to Door Ministries activities and planting
            more seeds for the Church and Jesus!  All they basically know is Satan!  Pray,
            pray and more prayer is usually the best thing you can do for them. They don't
            know the difference between Heaven and Hell, to them there is no difference!
            They desperately need
            <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=exodus+20&version=KJV" target="_blank">Exodus 20:1-17</a> and
            <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+10&version=KJV" target="_blank">Luke 10:27</a> through
            <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=galatians+3&version=KJV" target="_blank">Galatians 3:24</a>.
            These rebels are red flag types... caution, caution, caution!!!
        </p>

        <p>
            So regardless: if it is Type A (THE WILLING), Type B (THE LOST), Type C (THE
            REBELLIOUS)...the World Wide Door To Door Ministry march still goes on and
            <span class="underline italic">Your Ministry continues!</span>  If it is only
            3-6 contacts in a day/evening or 25-50 keep on moving on. The search regardless;
            if it is to fill up every seat in the Church or find that next Billy Graham, the
            seed has been planted!  Move on and plant another seed for your Church and the
            Kingdom of Jesus Christ!
